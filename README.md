# PieTimer
Code to speak how long is left until we get to eat glorius Pies

This program uses the in-built "espeak" command (for Linux) or "say" command (for OS X) to inform the user how long is left until Pie.
Currently, the defaults are set to assume Pie day is Friday and Pie time is 12:00:00. However, these can be easily configured should Pie Day or time change (for example to accommodate demonstrating schedules....)


## Update 17/02/2017
PieTimer v1.1 is released!
New features include
1) Removed class files from project to save space on GitHub

## Known Issues:
- Lack of Maven Support
- Lack of Test Cases
